The wekeypedia python toolkit is a set of class and helpers that have been
written during the overall wekeypedia project. Its main purpose is to give back
some shortcuts to the science community. We hope this work will help future data
scientist and web scrappers make them win some time about the tedious part of
the work, be able to spend more time on the more fun parts and conduct studies
with wikipedia materials.
