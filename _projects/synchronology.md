A proof concept inspired by ben fry's visualization of [Darwin's multiple editions of
<cite>On the origin of species](http://benfry.com/traces/). It was used to show the
possibility to observe graphically the dynamic of revisions of a predetermined
set of pages. The input is a preprocess texts corpus which are transformed as
blocks instead of text. It is also a preview of what can be visualize using
small multiple technics over sample of variations and rich content (hyperlinks,
 pictures, ect).
