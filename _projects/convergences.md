Convergences is a web visualization of convergences and divergences between the different languages of wikipedia as a proxy of distances between cultures.

While cultures and languages do not have a clear causal relationship. This kind of measurements can still help to understand the social representations of the wikipedia communities and their sub-cultures. It can also provide some interesting insights about the power structure between languages. For example, the difference in number of links for a page in two languages tells something about the importance of the concepts involved in the page within the language/culture and the dominance as differential power of a language over another one.
