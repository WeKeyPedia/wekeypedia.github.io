A small experiment to play around the strange traces let by some "vandals" of
the [Wikipedia page bout Love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love). It was also
a trial to foster the possibilities of natural language processing over delta
analysis of revisions. It was also a fun way to show how collective intelligence
energy is not only about straight out editing and quality. Wikipedia after all
is a public space with similarities with other spaces particulary in terms of
appropriations and non-intended usages.
